If you open the CoilSpring script, you'll notice some comments there.
For the Plunger, Bungee scenes  => //#define CALC_SPRING_COEFF
For the Bridge, CoilSpring	=> #define CALC_SPRING_COEFF

This is because for some we want to input that coefficient manually, and for others we want to calculate it

==========TROUBLESHOOTING EDITOR LAYOUT ISSUES ==========
Hey guys, if you encounter the double window issue, 
it's a problem related to the editor's layout.

If it asks you to reload, just press quit, it should open the second time.
After that modify the layout to 4x4 so it resets (top right corner).
=========================================================

Make sure you are using Unity 2020.2.0f1, or you may encounter difficulties when trying to open the project.
